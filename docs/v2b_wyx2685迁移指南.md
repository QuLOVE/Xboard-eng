# Migrating from V2Board (wyx2685 Version) - time to switch it up!

This guide's gonna walk you through migrating from the V2Board wyx2685 version (specifically as of November 17, 2023) to the Xboard experience. We're talkin' database changes, file migrations, the whole nine yards. 

**Heads up!** This guide was written on November 17, 2023. If you're using a different version of the wyx2685 fork, your migration might not go as planned.

*  **Device limits? Gone!**  The wyx2685 version added device limits, but those will be lost during migration. Sorry, homie. 
* **Trojan mysteries:** You'll also lose whatever magic wyx2685 worked on the Trojan protocol. What those changes were, we may never know...
*  **Hysteria2 reconfiguration:**  Your Hysteria2 lines will need to be reconfigured after the migration.

##  The nitty-gritty  -  database changes

Here's the lowdown on what's going to change in your database:

*  **`v2_plan` Table:** 
   * The `device_limit` field (nullable) is outta here!
* **`v2_server_hysteria` Table:**
   * We're saying goodbye to the `version`, `obfs`, and `obfs_password` fields.
* **`v2_server_trojan` Table:** 
   * The `network` and `network_settings` fields are gone.
* **`v2_user` Table:** 
   * The `device_limit` field is history. 

##  Before u begin - don't skip this part

1.  **Fresh xboard install (No SQLite!):**  Before you even think about migrating, install a fresh copy of Xboard.  And don't even TRY using SQLite -  choose a different database type.

   *   Need a hand with the installation? Check out these guides:
      *  [Docker Compose (Command Line)](./docs/docker-compose安装指南.md)
      *  [aaPanel + Docker Compose](./docs/aapanel+docker安装指南.md)
      *  [aaPanel](./docs/)

2.  **SQLite users, u'r on your own:**   If you're using SQLite,  you'll need to figure out the migration yourself.

##  Migration time -  let's do this!

### Docker environments

1.  **SSH and navigate:**  Open your terminal, SSH into your server, and navigate to your Xboard project directory.
2. **Shut down xboard:** 

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

3. **Clean slate for the database:**

   ```bash
   docker compose run -it --rm xboard php artisan db:wipe
   ```

4. **Import Your dtabase (Dont screw this up):**  Import your V2Board (wyx2685 version) database into the Xboard database you just wiped clean.  

5. **Migrate:** 

   ```bash
   docker compose run -it --rm xboard php artisan migratefromv2b wyx2685
   ```

### aaPanel environments

1. **Wipe the database:**

   ```bash
   php artisan db:wipe
   ```

2. **Import ur old db (for real, don' forget 'bout it!):** Import your V2Board (wyx2685 version) database into the Xboard database.  

3. **Migrate:**

   ```bash
   php artisan migratefromv2b wyx2685
   ```

## Migrate ur config file - the final countdown

After the database migration is done, you gotta migrate the `config/v2board.php` file. Xboard keeps its config settings in the database now. Check out the [Config File Migration Guide](./config迁移指南.md) for the details.
