# Limiting users to how many devices can connect at once - 'cause sharing is caring, but not that much

Aight, so we gotta keep those freeloaders in check, you know what I'm sayin'? Time to put a cap on how many devices can slurp up bandwidth on a single subscription. 

#### The game plan - here's how we rollin'

1. **Subscription limits:**  We gonna add a limit to each subscription, so users can only connect so many devices at once.
2. **User limits:** When someone grabs a subscription, that device limit gets attached to their account like a ball and chain.
3. **Show Those limits:** The backend gonna display those device limits on the user info, so we know who's tryin' to be slick. 
4. **Enforce the law:** When a user connects, we checkin' their IP against the list of active devices. Too many devices already connected?  That new connection gets shut down faster than a snitch in a police station. If a new IP manages to connect, we immediately report it to the Xboard backend.
5. **Report all traffic:** When we reportin' traffic, we includin' the user's IP so we know who's usin' what.

#### xboard gotta step up its game

We need some new moves from Xboard to make this happen:

1. **Get node user list:**  Xboard gotta give us a list of all users connected to a node, with their limits and active IPs. Like this:

   ```json
   { 
       "id": 1, 
       "uuid":"cd692137-3f7b-47fb-b7a3-037a203d6489", 
       "speed_limit": null, 
       "device_limit": 10, 
       "online_ips": ['1.1.1.1', '2.2.2.2']
   }
   ```

2. **Report new IPs:** When a new IP connects (and it's within the device limit), the backend reports it to Xboard.

   ```json
   {   
       "id": 1, 
       "new_online_ip": "3.3.3.3" 
   } 
   ```

   * **Successful report:** Xboard hits us back with  `{ "data":true }`
   * **Limit reached:**  If the device limit's been hit, Xboard sends back the list of already connected IPs:
     ```json
     {   
         "data": ['1.1.1.1','2.2.2.2','3.3.3.3','4.4.4.4','5.5.5.5']
     }
     ```

3. **Report traffic with IP:**  Every time we report traffic usage, we gotta include the user ID, traffic (upload/download), and the IP address:

   ```json
   {   
       "id":1, 
       "u": 100, 
       "d": 100, 
       "ip": "1.1.1.1"
   }
   ```

#### Keep it on the low -  security first, bro

We ain't about to leak user IPs like a busted pipe. To keep things on the DL:

1. **Hash those IPs:** We gonna hash the user IPs before we store 'em anywhere. 
2. **Hash verification:** When a user tries to connect, we hash their IP and check it against the stored hashes. No match, no connection. 

#### UI/UX - gotta make it look good

This whole thing's gotta be user-friendly, you know what I'm sayin'? 

**Admin pnel:**

* **Subscription limits:** Add a field to set device limits for each subscription.
* **User limits:**  Show and edit user device limits.
* **User list:** Display the number of active connections for each user.
* **Subscription lst:**  Show the total number of active users and IPs for each subscription.
* **Node view:** Display the number of active users and IPs for each node. 

**User frontend:**

* **Homepage:**  Show users how many devices are currently connected to their account, with a handy button to reset their subscription if they run into problems. 

#### Performance tweaks - gotta keep things runnin' smooth

We can't be boggin' down the system with all this extra data. Time for some optimization:

* **Compress that data:** We gonna use `brotli` compression to shrink the size of those traffic reports.
* **Real-Time communication:**  Instead of regular HTTP requests, we gonna use WebSockets or gRPC for reporting new IPs. Faster communication, smoother operation. 

There you have it, fam. A whole system for keepin' those bandwidth hogs in check.
