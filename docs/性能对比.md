# Performance showdown - this ain't no game, fam

We're talkin'  straight facts, hard numbers. Time to see how these bad boys stack up. 

## Test setup - what we r rollin' with 

Gotta keep it 100, transparency is key. This is the hardware we used for the beatdown:

* **CPU:** Intel 8255C
* **Cores:** 4
* **RAM:** 8GB

## Concurrency test -  handlin' the traffic like a Boss

This is where we see how many users these systems can handle at once. We used `wrk` to simulate a whole lotta traffic. 

| Test case      | Old way (php-fpm) | Old way (opcache) | Laravels | Webman (Docker) |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Homepage   | 6 requests/sec   | 157 requests/sec   | 477 requests/sec  | 803 requests/sec |
| User sub  | 6 requests/sec   | 196 requests/sec   | 586 requests/sec  | 1064 requests/sec|
| User home load time | 308ms       | 110ms          | 101ms     | 98ms            |

## Front-end load time -  gotta be snappy, know wha ama sayin?

We ain't just talkin' server performance here. We're talkin' how fast the user sees somethin' on their screen. This is the **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**, how long it takes for that first bit of content to pop up. 

> **Lower FCP is better, like your chances of getting busted with contraband.**

| Test case      | Old way (php-fpm) | Old way (opcache) | Laravels | Webman (Docker) |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Login page   | 7s / **2.9s** | 7s / **2.9s** | 7.1s / **2.7s** | 7.3s / **2.9s**|
| Signup page  | 7.1s / **3s** | 7s / **2.8s**  | 7.1s / **2.7s** | 7.3s / **2.9s**|

**Bottom line, homie:**  Xboard ain't just an upgrade, it's a whole different league. Faster performance, faster loading times...  You'd have to be a straight-up clown to stick with the old way.  ðŸ’¯
