# Migrating from V2Board 1.7.3 -  level up ur setup

This is your guide to migrating from V2Board 1.7.3 to the awesomeness that is Xboard. We're talkin' database changes, file migrations, the whole nine yards.

## What's gonna change?  -  The nitty-gritty

The migration script's gonna make some serious moves on your database:

* **Rename `v2_stat_order` to `v2_stat`:**  Because shorter names are always better.
    * Rename the `order_amount` field to `order_total`.
    * Rename the `commission_amount` field to `commission_total`.
    * Add a new `paid_count` field (integer, nullable).
    * Add a new `paid_total` field (integer, nullable).
    * Add a new `register_count` field (integer, nullable).
    * Add a new `invite_count` field (integer, nullable).
    * Add a new `transfer_used_total` field (string, length 32, nullable).
* **New Tables on the Block:** 
   * We're adding the `v2_log` table. 
   * The `v2_server_hysteria` table's joining the party.
   * And let's not forget the `v2_server_vless` table.

##  Before u start  -  dont skip ahead!

1. **Install Xboard:**  Yep, you gotta install Xboard fresh *before* you migrate. Choose any installation method *except* SQLite. We'll get to that later. 

   *  Check out these guides if you need help with installation:
     * [Docker Compose (Command Line)](./docs/docker-compose安装指南.md)
     * [aaPanel + Docker Compose](./docs/aapanel+docker安装指南.md)
     * [aaPanel](./docs/)

2. **SQLite?** If you're using SQLite, you're on yr own for the migration. Time to brush up on those database skills. 

## Migration time -  lets get it on

### Docker environments

1. **SSH and navigate:** Open ur terminal, SSH into your server, and navigate to your Xboard project directory.
2. **Stop Xboard:**

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

3. **Wipe the DB slate clean:** 

   ```bash
   docker compose run -it --rm xboard php artisan db:wipe
   ```

4. **Import yr old DB:**  **This is critical!** Import your V2Board 1.7.3 database into the newly created Xboard database.

5. **Migrate:** 

   ```bash
   docker compose run -it --rm xboard php artisan migratefromv2b 1.7.3
   ```

###  aaPanel environments

1. **Wipe that DB:**  

   ```bash
   php artisan db:wipe
   ```

2. **Import ur old DB:** Again, this is super important.  Import your V2Board 1.7.3 database into the Xboard database.

3. **Migrate:**

   ```bash
   php artisan migratefromv2b 1.7.3
   ```

##  Migrate ur config file  -  almost there!

After migrating your database, you gotta migrate the `config/v2board.php` file too.  Xboard stores config settings in the database now, not a file.  Check out the [Config File Migration Guide](./config迁移指南.md) for the steps.
