# Migrating from V2Board 1.7.4 -  upgrade your game

This is your guide to migrating from V2Board 1.7.4 to the Xboard experience. We're talking database changes, file migrations, the whole shebang.

##  The Changes  -  lets get specific

Here's what the migration script's gonna do to your database:

*  **New table alert:**  We're addin the `v2_server_vless` table to the mix. 

## Before u start - pay attention!

1. **Fresh install, no SQLite:** Before you even think about migrating, install a fresh copy of Xboard.  And don't even try using SQLite for this - choose a different database type.

   *  Need help with installation? We got you:
      * [Docker Compose (Command Line)](./docs/docker-compose安装指南.md)
      * [aaPanel + Docker Compose](./docs/aapanel+docker安装指南.md)
      * [aaPanel](./docs/)

2. **SQLite users:**  You're on your own for the migration if you're using SQLite. Time to break out those database skills.

## Migration time -  let's make it happen

### Docker environments

1. **SSH and navigate:** Open your terminal, SSH into your server, and navigate to your Xboard project directory.
2. **Stop Xboard:**

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

3. **Wipe the database clean:**

   ```bash
   docker compose run -it --rm xboard php artisan db:wipe
   ```

4. **Import ur old database:** **this is super important!** Import the database from your V2Board 1.7.4 installation into the newly wiped Xboard database. 

5. **Migrate:** 

   ```bash
   docker compose run -it --rm xboard php artisan migratefromv2b 1.7.4
   ```

### aaPanel environments

1. **Wipe the DB:**

   ```bash
   php artisan db:wipe
   ```

2. **Import ur old DB:** Again, you *gotta* import your V2Board 1.7.4 database into the Xboard database. 

3. **Migrate:**

   ```bash
   php artisan migratefromv2b 1.7.4
   ```

## Migrate ur config file -  the final touch

Once the database migration's done, you gotta migrate the `config/v2board.php` file too. Xboard's all about that database life now. Hit up the [Config File Migration Guide](./config迁移指南.md) for the steps.
